Abstract: The Covid-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions to workplace safety and productivity. Here we describe a browser-based interactive disease transmission simulation to enable managers and individuals (agents) to optimize safe office work activities during pandemic conditions. The ap-plication provides a user interface to evaluate the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on airborne disease exposure based on agentsâ€™ s meeting patterns and room properties. Exposure is calibrated using CO2 as a proxy for viral aerosol dispersion. For the building studied, major findings are cubicles during low occupancy produce unexpected high exposures, upgrading meeting to larger room reduces total average exposure by 44%, and when all meetings are con-ducted in large rooms, a 79% exposure reduction is realized.
